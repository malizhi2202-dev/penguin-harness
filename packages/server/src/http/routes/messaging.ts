/**
 * Messaging-binding routes: /api/sessions/:sessionId/messaging[...] — the binding
 * editor's and the Messaging dock panel's shared surface. A Session keeps at most one
 * saved config PER channel (all of them may sit saved side by side); the channel-agnostic
 * GET returns them all, and each channel owns a subtree with its own config shape —
 * /feishu, /telegram, /qq, /wechat and /tuitui carry the same verb set, and a further channel
 * adds its own.
 *
 * ENABLING the connection IS the binding, and disabling it is the unbind. Saving
 * credentials therefore never conflicts across Sessions — any number of Sessions may keep
 * the same Feishu app or Telegram bot saved, each with its own config and last-chat
 * memory — and both exclusivity rules sit on the state toggle instead: it refuses to
 * enable a channel while another channel of the SAME Session is enabled (409
 * `another_channel_enabled`), and to enable an account ANOTHER Session already has
 * enabled (409 `account_enabled_elsewhere` — one account has one event stream, so two
 * live connections on it would race). A config whose secret is missing is refused with
 * its channel's 400.
 *
 * Authorization mirrors the vault's split, through the sessions routes' resolveSession
 * pattern (404 never leaks a Session's existence): any Project member can read bindings
 * and run the two tests; the secret-mutating writes — PUT, the state toggle and DELETE —
 * are Project-owner-only.
 *
 * Two channels offer a scan-to-connect flow, and the server holds what makes it safe in both:
 * QQ's (`/qq/scan…`) keeps the AES key that decrypts the App Secret, WeChat's
 * (`/wechat/scan…`) keeps the poll handle that collects the bot token. Each polls on the
 * browser's behalf and stores the result; the browser only ever learns a task handle, the URL
 * to render as a QR code, and the non-secret account id that came back — the same
 * never-round-trip-the-secret rule the PUT handlers follow, applied to a secret that arrives
 * from outside instead of from the user. On WeChat the scan is not the convenient path but
 * the ONLY one: there is no console to copy a token out of, so its PUT carries preferences
 * alone.
 *
 * A PUT also carries the three saved fields that are not credentials: `linePerMessage`
 * (whether a relayed reply is delivered one message per non-blank line), `finalReplyOnly`
 * (whether a run relays only its last completed assistant message, at the run's end, instead
 * of each one as it completes) and `renderMarkdown` (whether its Markdown is rendered in the
 * channel's own markup). All three are ordinary form fields applied on Save — omitted keeps
 * the stored value — and none touches the connection.
 *
 * Round-trip rule for secrets: GET only ever returns the masked value, and a PUT whose
 * secret (feishu `appSecret`, telegram `botToken`, qq `appSecret`, tuitui `appSecret`) is omitted
 * or blank keeps the stored
 * one (the same never-round-trip-masked-keys convention as the models test endpoint), so
 * the plaintext exists only at first entry. Dropping a stored secret is the explicit
 * clear flag (the models-page idiom), refused while the binding is enabled — the cleared
 * config's row and account identity stay; full removal is the DELETE, which the web UI
 * no longer offers (API completeness only).
