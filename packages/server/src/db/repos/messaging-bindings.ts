/**
 * Repo for Session ↔ messaging-channel bot bindings (Feishu, Telegram, QQ and WeChat today).
 *
 * A Session keeps at most one saved config PER channel — the `(session_id, channel)`
 * primary key — and both channels' credentials may sit saved side by side. Which of them
 * (at most one) holds a live connection is the per-row `enabled` intent; the
 * one-enabled-per-session invariant is enforced by the state route (409
 * `another_channel_enabled`), not here — the repo stays a dumb store.
 *
 * Saving is NOT exclusive across Sessions: any number of Sessions may keep the same bot
 * account saved side by side, each with its own config document and its own last-chat
 * memory, so `upsert` has no failure mode at all. The one cross-session rule sits on the
 * connection instead — enabling a binding whose account is already enabled on another
 * Session is refused by the state route (409 `account_enabled_elsewhere`), which reads
 * `findEnabledByAccount` to see it. One account has one event stream, so two live
 * connections on it are meaningless; two saved configs are not.
 *
 * `line_per_message`, `final_reply_only` and `render_markdown` are delivery preferences
 * rather than credentials, which is why they are columns beside `enabled` and not keys inside
 * `config`: that document is the channel's own shape, owned by its connector, and these apply
 * to every channel identically — each channel renders what it can of the same request.
 *
 * `config` is the channel-specific credential/config document, stored as JSON. Secrets
 * inside it are plaintext at rest (same trade-off as the proxy address in
 * server_settings) and must be masked at every API surface — nothing here ever masks,
 * callers do. A cleared secret is stored as the empty string: the row, its non-secret
 * fields and its account identity stay. The repo does not interpret the document; each
 * channel's connector and route own its shape.
