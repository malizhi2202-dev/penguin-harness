/**
 * The half of Markdown relaying that must not differ per channel: reading the model's
 * reply as Markdown, and deciding where a reply too long for one message may be cut.
 *
 * It sits beside the connectors for the same reason media.ts does. The Agent writes one
 * reply, and which constructs that reply CONTAINS is a fact about the text, not about the
 * chat it lands in — so the dialect is fixed here (CommonMark plus GFM, matching what the
 * web transcript renders) and each connector renders the resulting tree into its own
 * markup. A channel that parsed for itself would disagree with the others about what the
 * model wrote, and the same reply would then carry different content in two chats.
 *
 * The parser is `remark-parse` + `remark-gfm` over `unified` — the stack packages/web
 * already renders Markdown with, so the two surfaces read a reply the same way. A parser
 * is not something to hand-roll here: emphasis, links and fenced code are context-
 * sensitive, and a substitution pass mangles exactly the replies (code containing
 * asterisks, nested emphasis, links with parentheses) that make the feature worth having.
 *
 * The RENDER is deliberately not shared. Four channels accept four different subsets —
 * Telegram has code and no headings, lists or tables; Feishu has all of them; QQ has
 * headings and lists but no code and no tables; WeChat reads Markdown itself, so its
 * renderer subtracts what the client will not show rather than translating — over three
 * different markups and four different escaping rules. (Tuitui is the reason this is four
 * renderers and not five channels: only its team posts take Markdown at all, and the platform
 * renders that itself, so its adapter passes the text through and needs no module here.) A printer parameterised over that
 * would be a table of capability flags whose every branch belongs to exactly one channel,
 * which is the connector's own job under a name that hides it. So each channel renders this
 * tree itself: telegram-html.ts, feishu-card.ts, qq-markdown.ts and wechat-markdown.ts, each
 * beside the adapter that sends its output. Nothing in this module knows any channel's
 * markup.
