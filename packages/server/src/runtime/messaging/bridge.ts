/**
 * Messaging bridge: a Web server runtime component connecting Sessions to external chat
 * platforms through channel connectors (Feishu, Telegram, QQ and WeChat today — see
 * feishu-connector.ts / telegram-connector.ts / qq-connector.ts). Started by the platform next to the
 * Scheduler, stopped when the
 * App is disposed — a hot swap hard-stops it like the scheduler. A Session may keep a
 * saved config per channel, but AT MOST ONE of them is enabled (the state route enforces
 * that), so the bridge holds at most one inbound event connection per Session — the
 * enabled binding's. `enabled` is stored intent the state toggle owns — saving
 * credentials never opens or closes a connection (with one deliberate exception:
 * re-saving an enabled binding restarts its connector with the new credentials, so the
 * stored config and the live connection never diverge).
 *
 * Inbound (channel → Session): a message the binding has already processed is dropped
 * first (see RecentInboundIds, seeded from the binding row so a restart does not forget) —
 * channels redeliver, and nothing downstream of here is idempotent. Then every inbound
 * message records its chat as the binding's reply target; a text message then starts a
 * Task on the bound Session as an ordinary user input — exactly as if typed into the web
 * composer, no marker block and no special sender (the model deliberately does not learn
 * where the message came from) — with `queueIfBusy`: a busy Session queues it as a
 * follow-up, never 409. A message carrying images becomes that same composer input with
 * the pictures attached: the caption's text (when there is one) plus one `image_url` part
 * per image, as a base64 `data:` URL, which is byte for byte the shape the web composer
 * submits. A message carrying FILES becomes the composer's other attachment shape: each
 * one is written into the Session scratchpad and named on the message text as an
 * `[attached file: <path>]` line, so the model opens it with its ordinary file tools and
 * the bytes never enter the conversation (see services/task-attachments.ts, which owns
 * that path and its caps for the web composer too). The three combine — text, images and
 * files in one message compose one input — and a message with none of them (sticker,
 * voice, video) gets a polite bilingual "not supported" reply. Only once that work is done
 * is the binding row's watermark advanced, so a process that dies mid-message has the
 * channel replay it rather than find it already marked.
 *
 * Outbound (Session → channel): the bridge subscribes to the Session's in-process channel
 * and relays the main conversation's completed assistant messages — by default each of them
 * on its own, the moment it completes: a run that writes working notes between tool calls
 * before its answer reaches the chat as that same sequence of messages, so the chat follows
 * the run as it happens. A binding with `finalReplyOnly` set holds them back instead and
 * delivers the run's LAST completed assistant text alone, at the run's end: the answer
 * without the working notes, at the cost of the chat hearing nothing while the run works.
 * Either way delivery is the same path — sent to the last known chat (a held reply to the chat
 * its run was ASKED in, captured at the run's start: it leaves late enough for another message
 * to have moved the conversation elsewhere), chunked under the channel's text-size limits, or,
 * when the binding's `linePerMessage` is set, split into one message per non-blank line first,
 * each of those chunked and the resulting burst paced (the two options compose: a binding with
 * both sends that final reply one message per line). With the binding's `renderMarkdown` set
 * (the default) each message additionally carries a request to render it: the connector
 * converts the model's Markdown into its own channel's markup and falls back to sending the
 * plain source if the channel refuses the result, so formatting is the only thing a rendering
 * failure can cost, and the chunking follows the request, cutting at boundaries the document
 * actually has (see markdown.ts). The outbound traffic of one entry is
 * serialised through a promise chain:
 * several messages completing in quick succession must reach the chat in the order they
 * completed. In a group chat the run's FIRST outbound message threads onto the inbound
 * one and everything after it is a plain send — one reply-to anchors the exchange, where
 * repeating it per message would stack a quote header over each of them; a direct chat is
 * plain sends throughout. Mirroring needs a known chat — web-initiated turns included;
 * before the first inbound message no chat is known and nothing is sent. Compaction output
 * (the summary the model streams between compaction events) is not a reply and is skipped,
 * and a connection joining mid-run relays nothing from that run rather than mirroring half a
 * reply. An `approval_request` additionally sends a one-line notice that a tool call is
 * waiting in the web UI — on the same chain, so it lands between replies instead of inside
 * one. That notice is not an assistant message, so `finalReplyOnly` never holds it: a run
 * blocked on approval is exactly when the chat must hear something.
 *
 * When the run ends, the files ITS DELIVERED TEXT mentioned follow it into the chat (see
 * reply-files.ts): path-like tokens that resolve inside the Workspace and actually exist,
 * pictures sent as pictures and everything else as attachments. Not "every file the run
 * wrote": the Agent's own words are what say which output was the point, and a chat window
 * is a bad place to receive a directory. What the caps drop is named in the chat rather
 * than dropped quietly.

   * below is affected by the difference.
   *
   * `at` is where to put it. A message relayed as it completes passes none and goes to the
   * chat the row names now, which is where the conversation is. A held reply passes the target
   * captured when its run started (see onTaskState), because it leaves at the run's END: a
   * second user writing in another forum topic meanwhile would otherwise take delivery of a
   * whole answer to a question they never asked, quoted onto their own message.
   *
   * A send failure is recorded, never thrown, so the chain behind it keeps
   * moving — and so do the messages behind it in THIS reply: one refused message (a 429 on
   * the third line of twelve) must not abandon the rest, which would leave a reply stopping
   * mid-sentence with nothing in the chat to say why. A binding with `linePerMessage` set
   * sends one message per non-blank line instead of one per reply (see splitReplyLines,
   * capped at the channel's own `replyBudget` where it declares one), paced
   * MESSAGING_LINE_DELAY_MS apart so the burst stays inside the channel's per-chat
   * allowance — chunking, threading and ordering are identical either way, and with the flag
   * off the send sequence is unchanged. In a group the run's
   * first outbound chunk threads onto the inbound message and
   * everything after it is a plain send: the reply-to relation names which message is being
   * answered, and one of them says it — repeating it per message and per chunk stacks quote
   * headers over the whole conversation.
   *
   * A binding with `renderMarkdown` set relays the model's Markdown as formatting rather
   * than as characters. The bridge only carries the REQUEST: the conversion is the
   * connector's, because what a channel can show and what it does with a rendering the
   * channel refuses are both channel-shaped (see MessagingSendOptions). What is not
   * channel-shaped is where a reply too long for one message may be cut, and that is why the
   * chunker changes with the flag — a cut through a code fence or an emphasis run costs the
   * construct everywhere, and on a strict parser costs the whole message's formatting.

   * Sends the files THIS RUN produced and its reply mentioned, after its text.
   *
   * `replyText` is what the run actually SENT, not everything it said: a binding with
   * `finalReplyOnly` set delivered one message, so that message is the whole of what this
   * scans (see onTaskState). A file named only in a held-back working note has nothing in
   * the chat to explain its arrival.
   *
   * `at` is where those words went, for the one caller whose text is not addressed to the live
   * chat (again the held reply). Files follow their words: a picture landing in a forum topic
   * where nothing named it is the same defect as one arriving unmentioned.
   *
   * Two filters, and both are load-bearing. The reply having said the name is what picks
   * the one output that was the point out of the dozen a run writes. The file being newer
   * than the run's start is what keeps that from becoming an exfiltration primitive: the
   * reply is steerable by whoever is in the chat, and on a mention-only rule a group member
   * who asks "what is in secrets.json?" gets the file uploaded by the very refusal that
   * declined to paste it. Containment (the Workspace and nothing narrower) lives in the
   * file service either way — see MessagingWorkspaceFiles.
   *
   * A file the run did not write is dropped SILENTLY, and so is a name matching no file at
   * all: the rule reads prose, so a reply that mentions the config it read — or describes a
   * `hello-world.md` it never wrote — is the ordinary case, and announcing those puts an
   * error-shaped line under correct answers. Both are logged instead. What IS named in the
   * chat is a file that exists and whose upload failed: there the reply promised something
   * that then did not arrive, which is the one case where silence reads as broken.
   *
   * Always plain sends, never a threaded reply: a run that mentions a file has by
   * definition already sent the text that mentions it, and that message took the group's
   * one reply-to. Nothing here throws — a batch that fails is recorded, and a single file
   * that fails does not stop the ones behind it.
