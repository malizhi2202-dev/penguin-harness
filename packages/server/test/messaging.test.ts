/**
 * Messaging-binding tests, Feishu side (the Telegram connector's mirror suite is
 * messaging-telegram.test.ts): the bind-by-enable model (saving is never exclusive,
 * enabling is), the
 * /api/sessions/:id/messaging/feishu routes (masking, secret keep-on-blank, the
 * save/enable split — PUT persists credentials only, POST /state owns the connection —
 * 409s, authz split, cascade on session delete), and the bridge's routing through a fake
 * Feishu SDK — inbound text becomes an ordinary user task
 * exactly as if typed in the composer (no marker, no special sender; queueIfBusy), an
 * inbound image becomes the composer's `image_url` part (and a download that fails or
 * exceeds the inline-image cap degrades to a notice instead of a half-message), an inbound
 * FILE becomes the composer's other attachment shape — written into the Session scratchpad
 * and named on the message text as an `[attached file: …]` line, under the server's own
 * attachment caps, with a size refusal, a permission refusal and a transfer failure each
 * answered by its own notice — anything else gets the bilingual not-supported reply,
 * each completed assistant message
 * mirrors on
 * its own to the last known chat as soon as it completes (the run's first one threaded onto
 * the inbound message in groups), the files the reply MENTIONED follow it (existing ones
 * only, pictures as pictures, capped by count and by size, escapes refused by the Workspace
 * file service), an approval_request sends the one-line notice behind whatever is already
 * going out, a binding with `linePerMessage` set delivers a reply one message per
 * non-blank line — paced, and with a refused message costing only itself — while an unset
 * one is byte-for-byte the original single message, and a binding with `finalReplyOnly` set
 * relays a run's last completed message alone, at the run's end, files included. No test
 * opens real network.
