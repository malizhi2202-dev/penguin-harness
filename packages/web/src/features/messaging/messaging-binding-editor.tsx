/**
 * Shared messaging binding editor — ONE implementation behind both the session-row dialog
 * and the conversation's Messaging dock panel (the two hosts differ only in where they
 * place the Save action and the FAQ folds, so the state machine is a hook and the pieces
 * are body components; neither host forks the form).
 *
 * Channel model: a Session keeps at most one saved config PER channel — all of them may
 * sit saved side by side — and AT MOST ONE of them is enabled. The channel selector
 * switches freely between the channel forms (each independently savable, each showing its
 * own configured/enabled state); enabling one channel while another is enabled is gated
 * with a "turn that one off first" hint (the server refuses it too, 409).
 *
 * The form opens on the connection controls and the credential fields trail them: the
 * channels' field lists differ in length, so controls placed under the fields would sit at
 * a different height in each channel and move on every switch. That is also why QQ's
 * replies-only rule — the one piece of channel copy too load-bearing to leave in a
 * collapsed fold — sits below its fields rather than above them. The explanation lives in
 * collapsed FAQ folds below the save area (`MessagingBindingHelp`), and the channel's
 * leading credential field — where the value starts being pasted — carries at its label's
 * top-right corner a link to wherever that channel issues the credential (the models-page
 * "get API key" idiom, which puts the link on the field, not in a row of its own). Secrets
 * follow that page's interaction: the field always starts empty, a stored secret shows as a
 * masked line under it with a "clear stored …" checkbox (typing unchecks it; applied on
 * Save), blank keeps the stored value — and clearing requires the channel's connection to be
 * disabled first. The connection switch IS the bind/unbind control — enabling binds the
 * bot to this conversation, turning it off releases it, and the credentials stay saved
 * through both, so several conversations may keep one bot saved and take turns holding it
 * (the server refuses a second live one with 409 `account_enabled_elsewhere`, naming
 * nothing about who holds it). That is semantics, so it is disclosed rather than parked on
 * screen: the switch carries it as its tooltip and the "what binding does" fold states it
 * in full. Deleting a stored credential remains a separate act — the per-field clear.
 *
 * Two channels lead their section with scan-to-connect, after which the server holds the
 * credentials without them ever passing through this browser. On QQ (`qq-scan-connect.tsx`)
 * the typed fields stay below the QR as the fallback; on WeChat
 * (`wechat-scan-connect.tsx`) there are no fields at all, because the bot token has no other
 * source — so that channel's section is the QR, the stored-token row, and nothing else.
 *
 * The GET is re-polled while the host shows the editor (the hook's `poll` flag) so
 * connect/error flips show up live.

          sit behind the label's "?" — see DeliveryOptionRow. Order is the order they take
          effect in: which messages are sent, then how each one is split, then how each of
          those is rendered. The Markdown row's sentence is the one that differs per channel,
          because what a channel can show is the whole of what the reader needs to decide.

          The one place a channel changes the answer rather than shading it: on QQ every send
          is a passive reply anchored to an inbound message, and that anchor expires, so
          holding the reply to the run's end loses a long run's output entirely instead of
          merely delaying it. That is a different outcome, not a nuance of the same one, so it
          is appended to this option's explanation — and only there. A standing strip under the
          row would be the third thing on this form permanently explaining a channel to someone
          who has already read it once; what belongs on screen is the switch, and what belongs
          behind the "?" is why you might not want it. `linePerMessage` needs nothing similar:
          QQ clamps the split to its own budget and the reply still arrives. */}
