/**
 * account-menu.ts unit tests: which sessions the sidebar user menu offers a
 * change-password entry to.
 *
 * The rule is pinned by value in all four combinations rather than by shape, because the
 * tempting simplification — keying on `desktopMode` alone, like the sibling sign-out and
 * Users entries do — is wrong in a way nothing else would catch: it also strips the
 * control from a browser signed in against a desktop-mode server over loopback, whose
 * password session can still change its password (server/test/desktop.test.ts, "keeps
 * requiring oldPassword for password-established sessions in desktop mode").
 *
 * vitest runs node-only here (`environment: "node"`, no jsdom), so this asserts against the
 * exported predicate rather than a rendered menu (title-reveal.test.ts convention).
